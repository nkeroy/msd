For Weather Forecast App,
the API extraction and relevant functions implemented are all in App.js.

src > App.js

App is a component class here that has a this.state to hold the API weather data from openweathermap.org.

componentDidMount() -> loads from the API and retrieves the weather data from today until 5 days later

handleDateChange(event) -> filters out the API data by user input date, once the user has input a date to get the weather forecast
